License and Acknowledgments
===========================

SharpOauth is an OAuth Consumer .Net Library Class developed in C# and distributed under the MIT License: 
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php

I've coded this library as part of an addin for Microsoft Office which calls an API using the OAuth protocol having failed to find a lightweight library on OAuth.net.
A fellow developer gave me a start by sharing with me some C# Code including the OAuthBase.cs class. It seems this class originated with Tim Pinkawa [http://www.timpinkawa.net/misc/oauthbasetwitter.html].
This work is built on these contributions.

It is shared on GIT Hub: https://github.com/samo9789

Code Samples
============

The code samples call the twitter API for test purposes.
You need a Twitter consumerKey and consumerSecret to run them.

The first code sample [sample1_twitterClient] calls the Twitter API like a Desktop/Mobile application would. That means that the authorization process is completed by entering a pincode (in the console window).
	=> To run this test, edit the file "Main.cs" and enter your consumerKey and consumerSecret then compile the project.
The second code sample [sample2_twitterWeb] calls the Twitter API as a web application. Once the authorization process is completed, twitter redirects the user to the callback URL you defined in your twitter application settings.
	=> To run this test, edit the configuration file "web.config", enter your consumerKey and consumerSecret then recompile the application.

Compatibility
=============

I've tested this library in my Office Addin on a Microsoft Windows XP Environment with Visual Studio Pro.
I've also worked with this library on Mac OS X using MonoOSX and MonoDevelop in order to develop the first code sample.
